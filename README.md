# Sami Nieminen Design and Frontend Portfolio
This repository contains a listing of my design and frontend development related projects for ease of access

## [Products Bazaar Concept](https://github.com/samniem/products-bazaar-concept)
This is a project applying Thinking in React principles to a simple search functionality for multiple data tables. The minimalist design was my first ever Adobe XD design project. The React coding style makes use of hooks inside stateful components. The project also applies Ramda library functions for grouping data for the tables in a consice but effective manner. 

## [Login and Manage User Data with Adobe XD and React](https://github.com/samniem/login-and-manage-user-data)
A project making use of Adobe XD for designing a two views user interface with one view for login management and the second for managing user data. The project uses form components and grids as a demonstration of my knowledge to apply these concepts to the implementation of a design. 

## [Restful Cats](https://github.com/samniem/restfulcats)
This is a project I did back in 2019 when I applied for my first web development related role at Telia. The project is old and the associated Heroku link is most likely not working anymore. However, I would say that the frontend with the Telia logo like cat is worth showing off.
